Files with "kmt-edition" in their names are created by the
KMoreTools authors because nothing suitable was provided upstream.

The goal should be bring the stuff upstream.

All other files are copies of the upstream desktop file and 32x32 icon.
The filename of the icon is specified in the .desktop file.
